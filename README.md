# SP-Proxy
### 1st EVER Self-Propagating ProxyChains: Beta v0.1 Auto-Sourced ProxyChains, SOCK4/5 & HTTP - Automated List Sourcing, Verification and Formatting. Gets Everything Ready For Your "proxychains4.conf" (located: /etc/proxychains4.conf) Kali OS*
This is without many features to come, multiple and custom sourcing, an Original UDP through TCP SOCK5, Original UDP through TOR and My Well Known "TOR_HOOK" all precursors to my upcoming "Anonymous-Toolset"


☆This script will currently download socks4/5 and HTTP proxy lists, format and validate/saving the working proxy servers to use in your proxychains.☆


*If anyone wants to help out with a better name I'm all ears lol

This is just a beta, don't expect if to work without going through the source code and tweaking some things. I made a general "installer"
### TO INSTALL: Copy and Paste the following into a terminal *Kali OS
sudo git clone https://github.com/MBHudson/SP-Proxy.git | sudo chmod -R 777 SP-Proxy/ | cd PS-Proxy | ./installer | ./spProxy
