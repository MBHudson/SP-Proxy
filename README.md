# SP-Proxy
### SP-Proxy: 1st EVER Self-Propagating ProxyChains: Beta v0. 1 Auto-Sourced ProxyChains, SOCK4/5 & HTTP - Downloaded, Verified and Formatted and Ready For Your "proxychains4.conf" (located: /etc/proxychains4.conf) Kali OS*
This is without many features to come, multiple and custom sourcing, an Original UPD through TCP SOCK5, Original UPD through TOR and My Well Known "TOR_HOOK" all precursors to my upcoming "Anonymous-Toolset"

*if anyone wants to help out with a better name im all ears lol

this is just a beta, don't expect if to work without going through the source code and tweaking some things. I made a general "installer"
### TO INSTALL
sudo git clone https://github.com/MBHudson/SP-Proxy.git | cd SP-Proxy | sudo chmod -R 777 SP-Proxy/ | ./installer | ./spProxy
